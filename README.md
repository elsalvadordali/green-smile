## Our Goal:

- Grow a better world with Happy Garden!
- Daily add a positive thought, a grateful note, or an inspirational phrase to "feed" your plant. As your plant grows, may this daily mindfulness exercise bring some peace and serenity into your hectic life and boost your mood.
- On days when you don't have anything to add, go back and review past entries for a positive spin to your day.
- The mind is a powerful tool. Let's use it ito improve our lives and the lives of those around us, one positive entry at a time. Grow your positive mindset!

## Takeaways:

Happy Garden was built for the GDI Hackathon 2022 - Hack for Health! We were given 48hours to start and accomplish the project.
All of the team members are first time hackers and it has proven to be challenging, and a rewarding experience for us! The Happy Garden app won and landed thrid place!
2 days after deployment, it has already garnered almost 100 users!
